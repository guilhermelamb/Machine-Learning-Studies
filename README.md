## Machine Learning Studies

I created this repository to store my machine learning study files.

In the future, I also plan to put theoretical content on each subject studied, so this repository can serve as a quick reference for theoretical and practical subjects.

Feel free to look at each topic =)

* [Databases](https://github.com/guilhermelamb/Machine-Learning-Studies/tree/main/Databases)
* [Decision Tree](https://github.com/guilhermelamb/Machine-Learning-Studies/tree/main/Decision%20Tree)
* [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/guilhermelamb/Machine-Learning-Studies/tree/main/Naive%20Bayes)
* [Pre-Processing](https://github.com/guilhermelamb/Machine-Learning-Studies/tree/main/Pre-Processing)

(Suggestions on how to improve the code and this repository and tips on study materials are always welcome)
