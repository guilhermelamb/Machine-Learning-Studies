## Machine Learning Studies

I created this repository to store my machine learning study files.

In the future, I also plan to put theoretical content on each subject studied, so this repository can serve as a quick reference for theoretical and practical subjects.

Feel free to look at each topic =)

    * [Databases](#Databases)
    * [Decision Tree](#Decision-Tree)
    * [Naive Bayes](#Naive-Bayes)
    * [Pre-Processing](#Pre-Processing)

(Suggestions on how to improve the code and this repository and tips on study materials are always welcome)
